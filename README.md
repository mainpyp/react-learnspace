# Adrians React Learnspace
This repository is used as a space throughout my React journey. I will mainly go through the Udemy Tutorial "[The Ultimate React Course 2024](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/?couponCode=ACCAGE0923)" and will add further sources and notes.


## Project Structure
Teacher repository is the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann/ultimate-react-course) provided by the course teacher. It is excluded from the repository. 
I cloned it into that directory and ran 
```bash
mv teachers-repository/ultimate-react-course/* teachers-repository
rm -rf teachers-repository/
```
```
