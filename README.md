# Adrians React Learnspace

This repository is used as a space throughout my React journey. I will mainly go through the Udemy Tutorial "[The Ultimate React Course 2024](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/?couponCode=ACCAGE0923)" by Jonas Schmedtmann and will add further sources and notes.

## Project Structure Teacher repository is the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann/ultimate-react-course) provided by the course teacher. It is excluded from the repository. I cloned it into that directory and ran

```bash
mv teachers-repository/ultimate-react-course/* teachers-repository
rm -rf teachers-repository/
```

In the `misc` directory I will store random files that I will use throughout the course. The `notes` directory will contain all notes I take throughout the course. The `projects` directory will contain all projects and tutorial scripts I will create throughout the course. This will be overallping with the code provided by the lecturer but adapted to my needs.

```bash
README.md
|---notes
    |--- Chapter 1
|-- projects
|-- teachers-repositor
|-- misc
    |-- random.html files
```
