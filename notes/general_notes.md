# General Information
## What is React?
## React vs. ReactNative
**React** is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily for web applications. **React Native**, on the other hand, is a framework that allows developers to build mobile applications using React. While React targets web browsers, React Native targets mobile platforms like iOS and Android, allowing for the creation of native mobile apps with a single codebase.

If you are familiar with React, learning React Native is relatively easy. The main challenge lies in understanding mobile-specific components and platform-specific details, but the core learning curve is minimal.
